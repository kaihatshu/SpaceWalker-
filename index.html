      Here in space walking website you can get a Picture(idea) on how to get to space through our silent service.
      Are you a billionare? Who wants to go to Mars because people on Earth are no damn good- a misogamist or have
      "Elon"
      syndrome. hahahahahaaaah
      No you don't have to be a billionare for that you can be a
      <br>We often refer to our expanding universe with one simple word: space. But where does space begin and, more
      importantly, what is it?
      Space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely low pressure. In space, sound doesn't
      carry because there aren't molecules close enough together to transmit sound between them. Not quite empty, bits
      of
      gas, dust and other matter floats around "emptier" areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can host
      planets, stars and galaxies. From our Earth-bound perspective, outer space is most often thought to begin about 62
      miles (100 kilometers) above sea level at what is known as the Kármán line. This is an imaginary boundary at an
      altitude where there is no appreciable air to breathe or scatter light. Passing this altitude, blue starts to give
      way to black because oxygen molecules are not in enough abundance to make the sky blue.<br>The plan is this:
      NASA’s Perseverance Rover, which has scouted 13 kilometres of the martian surface and acquired 17 rock and
      regolith samples and one atmospheric sample since its arrival in 2021, will deliver samples to the NASA Sample
      Retrieval lander (SRL). The SRL is quipped with an ESA 2.5 m Sample Transfer Arm and a rocket for launching the
      sample container into martian orbit. Once there, an ESA spacecraft will capture the container and bring it safely
      to Earth.
      The backup plan is to create a depot of samples by early 2023, should the rover be unable to deliver the samples
      itself to lander in 2030. This reconfiguration of the campaign now. </p>
